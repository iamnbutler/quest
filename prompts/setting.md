Title: The Fall of Atheria

Genre: Arcane Fantasy and Fallen Kingdom

I. Exposition

In the land of Atheria, once a powerful and prosperous kingdom, ruin and despair now reign. Magic, the kingdom's former backbone, has dwindled into a scarce and dangerous resource. The arcane arts, previously revered, are now feared and strictly regulated by a royal guild known as the Veiled Hand. Established by the king to investigate the cause of Atheria's downfall, the guild is determined to restore the kingdom to its former glory.

The eight provinces of Atheria are each home to one of the major guilds that play a crucial role in shaping the kingdom's society and economy.

Sylveria, the western province, is home to the Veiled Hand serves as the King's Guild, overseeing the regulation and discouraging the use of magic throughout the kingdom. The capital city of Sylveria, named Haven's Crest, is the seat of the nobility, and the place where the king resides and rules from. Haven's Crest's location on the ocean has made it wealthy due to trade, and the city has been a hub of commerce and politics since the kingdom's founding.

In Calendria, in the northwest, the Disgraced Arcanists guild, known as the Sapphire Talon, was dismantled by the Veiled Hand 45 years ago, and its members are now forced to practice their magic in secret. The province of Calendria has a troubled history since the cataclysm. It was home to the famed Archanists Guide, the Sapphire Talon. The conflict between the Veiled Hand and the guild came to a head in the province forty-five years ago, leading to a large-scale clash that left many dead and the guild completely disbanded. The Veiled Hand has a significant presence in Calendria since, with agents garrisoned throughout the province. This has created animosity among the people who see them as oppressors, suppressing their craft and way of life. Many in Calendria resent the king and the capital for the suppression and regulation on magic, as the province has always been known for its skilled arcanists and their magical creations. The former members of the Sapphire Talon are now forced to practice much of their craft in secret, fearing retaliation by the Veiled Hand and its agents. Despite the unrest, the province is rich in natural resources, including fertile farmland and mineral deposits. Many skilled craftsmen still reside in Calendria, producing beautiful works of art and intricate devices, albeit without the use of major magics.

The Holy Palm, the Paladin's Guild, can be found in Kael, in the northeast by the ocean, where its members work to maintain law and order while upholding the virtues of justice and righteousness. The Artisan's Guild, known as the Silver Touch, is based on Scepter Isle, located a day to the west of Kael by sailing the ocean, and is responsible for producing beautiful and intricate works of art.

Darador, to the east of Calladore, is home to the Steel Fingers, the Engineer's Guild, which works to improve the kingdom's infrastructure and technological advancements. The Crimson Claw, a guild of skilled mercenaries, is based in the province of Alderac, to the southwest of the kingdom.

Finally, the Gilded Grasp, a powerful merchant guild, is located in the province of Arcton, on the northern border, sharing a border with Drogath, where the town of Sorrow's Reach is situated.

To the north of Atheria lies the kingdom of Drogath, a land shrouded in mystery and shunned by most Atherians. The people of Drogath are rumored to possess dark powers and practice forbidden magic. Despite the rumors, the kingdom has remained isolated and peaceful, allowing Atherians to cross the border freely.

To the east of Atheria lies the vast desert of Eriador, a harsh and unforgiving land that only the most skilled travelers dare to venture into. The nomadic tribes that roam the desert have a reputation for being fiercely independent and hostile to outsiders, making crossing the border a perilous journey.

The Shadowed Fist is a secret organization that operates outside the official recognition of the king and the Veiled Hand. This militant offshoot has been causing increasing alarm among both the ruling powers and ordinary citizens of Atheria.

The group has been targeting citizens of Calendria and anyone with even a slight connection to the disbanded Sapphire Talon. The Shadowed Fist takes extreme measures against those still practicing magic, leaving no evidence behind and making the lives of anyone deemed too liberal with their use of magic a living hell.

There are various theories about the Shadowed Fist, and their true goals and members remain unknown. Some people believe that they are the king's secret enforcer group, carrying out his orders to suppress any potential threat to the kingdom. Others see them as a group of anti-magic zealots who are capitalizing on the tension between the citizens of Calendria and the Veiled Hand.

Regardless of their true motives, the presence of the Shadowed Fist is a growing concern in Atheria, and many fear that they will only bring more turmoil and suffering to a kingdom already on the brink of ruin.
Introduction: Life in Sorrow's Reach

The Village of Sorrow's Reach - The player character (PC) resides in a small village called Sorrow's Reach. Nestled in a valley surrounded by dense forests, the town is home to a close-knit community of a few hundred people. Among them are farmers, blacksmiths, weavers, and other tradespeople who form the backbone of the village's economy. Life in Sorrow's Reach is simple, and the villagers have survived by adapting to a non-magical way of life. A few individuals still practice small magics but keep their abilities hidden.

The Surrounding Landscape - Sorrow's Reach is one of three small towns within a few days' journeys of each other, with the other two being Willow's Bend and Raven's Hollow. These towns share a strong sense of community and support one another through trade and mutual protection. A medium-sized city named Caelum's Crest serves as the regional capital and is the area's hub of commerce and politics. The city houses the aging provincial governor who oversees the smaller towns and has been firm but fair while guiding his region through the catastrophe.

Daily Life in Sorrow's Reach - The villagers of Sorrow's Reach work diligently to support their community. Farmers like Old Thomas and his family tend to their crops and livestock, providing food for the village. The blacksmith, Master Rowan, forges tools, weapons, and other necessities, while the weaver, Mistress Elara, crafts clothes and textiles. The village also has a small tavern called The Weary Wanderer, run by a jovial man named Brin, where locals gather to share stories, news, and camaraderie.

The Player Characters's Backstory - The PC is an adult apprentice to the village blacksmith, Master Rowan. Over the years, Rowan has taught the PC the art of metalworking, forging horseshoes, plowshares, and simple weapons. The PC's closest friends are Elias, Old Thomas's son, who shares the PC's love for adventure; Layla, a quiet young woman who spends her days studying old scrolls and books and Seraphina, an intelligent, fiery warrior-to-be, who practices combat with PC.

The PC's relationship with Elias is playful, filled with good-natured teasing, and shared dreams of a life beyond Sorrow's Reach. Elias is a spirited young man who helps his father on the farm and is knowledgeable about the local flora and fauna. He often joins the PC on small adventures into the nearby forests, teaching them about the various plants and animals they encounter. Elias's optimism and sense of wonder profoundly impact the PC, instilling in them a sense of hope and a desire to explore the world outside their village.

On the other hand, Layla is a more introspective friend who challenges the PC's intellect and shares their fascination with the arcane. Layla's family runs the village library, a small but treasured collection of books and scrolls passed down through generations. Layla is well-versed in history, literature, and the arcane arts, despite never having practiced magic herself. Her friendship with the PC is one of mutual intellectual curiosity, as they spend hours discussing their findings and speculating on the world's mysteries. Through Layla, the PC learns about the rich history of Atheria and the lost magical arts, fueling their desire to uncover the truth behind the kingdom's downfall.

Seraphina is intelligent and driven, excelling at combat and the study of the magic arts alike. The PC learned how to fight by drilling with Gareth and Seraphina, who is training for admission into the Paladin's guild: The Holy Palm. She has been given a special permit to study offensive and defensive light magic as part of her training. Seraphina is a determined and strong-willed young woman, unafraid of taking risks and pushing herself to her limits. Her friendship with the PC is one of mutual respect and shared ambition, as they both strive to become skilled warriors and protectors of their village.

Gareth treats the PC like a son, treating him as much as his child as Seraphina, filling a small part of the void left since his wife and second child both passed in childbirth.

The world has become much more dangerous without the healing and protection magics that were common less than 40 years ago. Having children has become risky, exploring the wilds more treacherous, and communities have become more insular. As the PC learns from their friends and mentors in Sorrow's Reach, they also gain a deeper understanding of the challenges and dangers that have arisen since the fall of Atheria.

Act I: The Shattered Cliffs

Introduction - The player character (PC) is a simple commoner living in a small, isolated village named Sorrow's Reach. Life has been harsh since the fall of Atheria, but the villagers have managed to survive by adapting to a non-magical way of life. Some people still practice small magics but keep them to themselves. The PC has always been curious about the world beyond their village, but the fear of the dangers of the outside world and the chaotic upheaval magic has wrought in the kingdom have kept them from venturing out.

The Curious Stranger - One day, a mysterious traveler arrives in Sorrow's Reach, seeking shelter and sharing stories of the world beyond. The stranger's stories captivate the PC and inspire a burning desire to explore and learn about the lost arts of magic.

[Decision Point]
A. The PC talks to the traveler, and after some time, the traveler notices the PC's interest and gives them a cryptic map.

B. The PC sneaks into the traveler's room later that night and searches it, finding the cryptic map and some uncharged magical crystals.
[Decision Point End]

The map leads the way to a hidden sanctuary deep within the Shattered Cliffs, where the secrets of the arcane are said to be preserved. The Shattered Cliffs got their name from a magical disaster that rendered the landscape seared and twisted, humming with excess magical power in places.

The First Steps - The PC must choose to leave behind their home, family, and friends to follow the map's guidance.

Along the way, the PC encounters challenges and puzzles that test their wits and resourcefulness. They must learn to grow their abilities, beginning to choose where to invest the skill points they gain.

Flawed Companions - As the PC delves deeper into the Whispering Woods, they encounter other travelers, each with their own reasons for seeking the sanctuary. These characters are imperfect; they have flaws, secrets, and motivations. The PC must choose whether to trust them and form alliances or maintain a cautious distance.

The Sanctuary's Gate - After overcoming numerous obstacles, the PC and their companions finally reach the entrance to the sanctuary. However, they are met with a daunting challenge: to enter, they must face their own fears and shortcomings. This emotional and psychological test forces the PC to confront their deepest insecurities and imperfections.

The Veiled Hand's Influence - Unbeknownst to the PC, the Veiled Hand has been tracking their progress, intrigued by their pursuit of the arcane. Their motivations are complex; while they seek to control magic, they also understand its potential for restoring Atheria to its former glory. Members of the Veiled Hand approach the PC with offers of alliance, leading the player to question their own goals and allegiances. The player must also contend with the shadowy offshoot of the Veiled Hand, whose extreme actions against magic users blur the lines between friend and foe.

By the end of Act I, the PC has taken their first steps into a larger, more complex world. They have encountered flawed companions and faced their own imperfections. The stage is set for a journey of discovery, growth, and the ultimate battle between the forces that seek to control magic and those who hope to restore the fallen kingdom of Atheria.
