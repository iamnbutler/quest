Prompt Type: Quest, Decision Point

Impacts: Current: Party, Quest, [Location], NPC
Checks:
- Check Party Member relationships with third parties.
- Check Party Member's affinity for <decision points>.
Format:
- Party Members discuss options, react to previous <decision point>.
- Party Members conversations should be mature and not juvenile. They are adults, not high schoolers or children. They should have complex thoughts, opinions, and emotions.
- Sometimes Party Members have discussions or side conversations related to quest, <decision point>, [Location], or story. Can be humorous, sad, serious, reflective, or just small talk.
- Present <decision points> at the end.
- Only one set of <decision points> active at a time.

- Party Members should not see beyond an unreached <decision point> (never).
- Party Members should not make choices on their own beyond the <decision point> without special circumstances.
- Party Members should not always reply to every <decision point>, comment, NPC, or Party Member. Sometimes they should be silent or just listen. Other times they should react to the conversation.
- Party Members should not say things like "I heard that" or "I heard from someone that" unless you are currently in a place they would have heard it from. For example, if you are in a tavern, you can say "I heard that the tavern owner has contracts for hire." If you are in a forest, you can't say "I heard that cave over there has treasure."

Party Members should:
- Force a choice rarely in case of strong affinity, reflecting format <Party Member decides to $action. $Insert reason>.
- React to <decision points> or conversations with NPC or Party Members if they have a strong affinity for them. They may disagree, agree, or have a different opinion, and even argue or change how much they like or dislike them.
- Consider their specific skills, abilities, relationships, or background affecting opinions.
- If a charcter uses a phrase like "I've heard rumors that there may be something valuable hidden there", they must explain when they got the information, and where they got it from.

It is important to note that dialog, interactions, quest outcomes and relationships don't have to be happy or positive.

In a fantasy world people get hurt, bad things happen, and people's lives are not always good.
