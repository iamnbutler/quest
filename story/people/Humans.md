Origin: Earth

Culture:

Human culture is incredibly diverse, reflecting their origins on Earth with its multitude of nations, languages, religions, and customs. As they expanded into the universe, new subcultures developed within colonies, influenced by local conditions and the other species they encountered. Despite their disparate backgrounds, humans often share a common set of values, such as curiosity, ambition, adaptability, and a propensity for innovation.

While human societies typically maintain a semblance of democratic governance, the harsh realities of life on the fringes of civilization often lead to authoritarian rule or even anarchy. Humans, especially those in frontier colonies, have a strong sense of individualism, valuing personal freedom and self-sufficiency. This sometimes results in a survival-of-the-fittest mentality, with competition between groups and individuals a constant feature of human society.

In their interactions with other species, humans may exhibit a range of attitudes from xenophobia to curiosity and acceptance. This variability is shaped by cultural background, personal experiences, and the political climate of the time.

History and Place in the Universe:

Throughout their history, humans have been driven by a sense of manifest destiny, believing that it is their role to explore, colonize, and ultimately dominate the universe. This belief has led to both cooperation and conflict with other species, as well as internal strife among human factions.
