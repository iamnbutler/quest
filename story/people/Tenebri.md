Tenebri

Origin:
Nyxos - Gliese 674

Appearance:

The Tenebri are an aquatic species with a humanoid form, standing shorter than the average human at approximately 1.2 meters (4 feet) tall. Their bodies exhibit various adaptations for living in the ocean while maintaining the ability to survive on land, much like turtles.

Their skin is smooth and covered in a fine layer of translucent scales, providing a unique sheen reminiscent of various marine creatures. Their coloration ranges from shades of blue, green, and purple, with some individuals displaying bioluminescent markings that serve as both a means of communication and camouflage.

The Tenebri possess a flexible spine and strong limbs, which allow them to swim gracefully through water and maneuver on land with ease. Their hands and feet have webbing between the fingers and toes, enhancing their swimming capabilities. Additionally, they have retractable gill-like structures on the sides of their necks, enabling them to extract oxygen from water, while also possessing lungs for breathing air.

Their heads feature large, expressive eyes with a nictitating membrane, offering protection and clear vision in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. The Tenebri have a small, streamlined nose and a mouth equipped with rows of sharp, needle-like teeth for consuming their primarily fish-based diet.

The Tenebri require immersion in water at least twice a day to maintain their health and well-being. As a result, they have developed advanced technologies and systems to ensure access to water sources, even when traveling through space or visiting other planets.

As a spacefaring civilization, the Tenebri have developed advanced technological solutions to survive outside their aquatic habitats. They wear specialized suits, designed to keep their skin moist and maintain a comfortable humidity level. These suits are equipped with a built-in system that recycles water, ensuring the Tenebri remain adequately hydrated during prolonged periods away from water sources.

Culture:

The Tenebri are a deeply spiritual species, with a strong connection to their oceanic home and the bioluminescent creatures that inhabit it. Their culture is centered around the concept of balance and harmony, both within themselves and with the world around them.

Their language is based on patterns of light, with each sequence representing a different meaning or emotion. This unique form of communication has allowed the Tenebri to develop complex art forms, such as light shows and dances, that are both beautiful and meaningful.

The Tenebri value knowledge above all else, and their scientists are highly respected throughout the galaxy. They have made significant contributions to fields such as biology, chemistry, and astronomy, but they guard their discoveries closely.

Despite their love for learning, the Tenebri are also fiercely protective of their secrets. They believe that some things are not meant to be shared with outsiders and will go to great lengths to keep their knowledge from falling into the wrong hands.

Society:

The Tenebri highly value knowledge, and their scientists have earned great respect throughout the galaxy. They have made significant contributions to fields such as biology, chemistry, and astronomy, though they tend to guard their discoveries closely.

Tenebri society consists of two major groups with differing ideologies, the Lumi'vola (Luminescent Guardians) and the Nova'xilar (Galactic Pioneers), as well as a rogue faction known as the Veza'koras (Dark Currents).

The Lumi'vola, or Luminescent Guardians, are a conservative exclusionist faction that firmly believes in the preservation of Tenebri culture and knowledge. They advocate for limited interaction with other species, maintaining that Tenebri secrets should be kept within their society and not shared with outsiders. In their view, this approach best safeguards the integrity and wellbeing of their people.

The Nova'xilar, or Galactic Pioneers, on the other hand, seek to create connections with the greater universe. While they still value the secrets of Nyxos and Tenebri society, they believe that selective sharing of knowledge and cultural exchange can benefit both the Tenebri and other civilizations. By engaging in trade and forming alliances, the Nova'xilar hope to gain knowledge about the universe and improve their understanding of their place within it. This group currently holds the majority in political power.

In contrast, the Veza'koras, or Dark Currents, are a radicalist offshoot of the Lumi'vola that not only supports the exclusionist viewpoint but actively works to sabotage any attempts by other species to forge ties with the Tenebri. They view external influence as a threat to the Tenebri way of life and take extreme measures to protect their people and culture from perceived threats, operating as a rogue faction.

Recent conflicts and tensions in the universe have led to growing support for the Lumi'vola's conservative stance. A rising number of Tenebri are in favor of closing off relations with the universe, fearing the potential risks of increased interaction with other species. The delicate balance between the factions continues to shape Tenebri society and their interactions with the wider cosmos.

Relations with other species:

The Tenebri have had mixed relations with other species throughout history. Their unique abilities have often sparked curiosity and fascination in others, but they have also been viewed with suspicion due to their secretive nature.

Their relationship with humanity has been relatively positive since first contact in 2489. The two species have engaged in joint research initiatives and trade agreements that have benefited both parties. However, there have been incidents where rogue factions of Tenebri have attempted to manipulate human affairs for their own gain.

The Tenebri's relationship with the [[Mantasari]] is more complex. The two species initially formed an alliance based on shared interests in oceanic research, but tensions arose when the Veza'koras nearly sparked a war between the Mantasari and [humanity](humans.md) through covert means. This incident has soured relations between the two species, but there are still those who hope to repair the damage done.

On most core worlds Tenebri can be found with varying frequency. Companies and crews that can deal with their unique needs will often hire Tenebri as researchers, biologists and doctors due to their deep knowledge and affinity.

History:

In 2489, humanity established diplomatic relations with the Tenebri, a private species from Nyxos in the Gliese 674 system. The Tenebri opened up new trade opportunities and joint research initiatives, driven by their interest in studying Earth's oceanic life. In 2502, the Nova'xilar and Lumi'vola factions emerged among the Tenebri, with the Lumi'vola feeling overshadowed by the Nova'xilar's growing influence and wary of human involvement in Tenebri affairs. The fragile alliance between the Mantasari and humanity was almost shattered in 2540 by the rogue Tenebri faction Veza'koras (Dark Currents), but the true Tenebri disavowed any knowledge of their actions.

In 2489, the UNSA made diplomatic contact with the Tenebri, opening up new trade opportunities and joint research initiatives. The Tenebri were eager to study the diverse oceanic life on Earth, which was vastly different from their own planet's aquatic creatures. This exchange of knowledge helped to foster positive relations between the Tenebri and other species.

The Tenebri assisted in establishing the multispecies research corporation Novacore on Nyxos in 2653, focused on studying marine ecosystems and conservation. Despite their involvement, the Lumi'vola faction's unease continued to intensify. In 2714, the Tenebri joined a joint task force with [[Mantasari]] and [human](humans.md) military forces to combat a growing trafficking ring of sentients in the Epsilon Indi system, significantly decreasing piracy in the region.

In 2756, a sudden coup attempt by the Lumi'vola against the Nova'xilar triggered an intense Tenebri civil war on Nyxos. After five years of fighting, the Lumi'vola were put down, and the Belrians provided a garrison to keep the peace while the Tenebri rebuilt their society. As of 2816, the Tenebri remained an influential species, known for their contributions to science and art. However, the delicate balance of their internal factions and relationships with other species left their future uncertain.
