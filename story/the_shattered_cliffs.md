Act I: The Shattered Cliffs

Introduction - The {PC} is a simple commoner living in a small, isolated village named Sorrow's Reach. Life has been harsh since the fall of Atheria, but the villagers have managed to survive by adapting to a non-magical way of life. Some people still practice small magics but keep them to themselves. The PC has always been curious about the world beyond their village, but the fear of the dangers of the outside world and the chaotic upheaval magic has wrought in the kingdom have kept them from venturing out.

The Curious Stranger - One day, a mysterious traveler arrives in Sorrow's Reach, seeking shelter and sharing stories of the world beyond. The stranger's stories captivate the PC and inspire a burning desire to explore and learn about the lost arts of magic.

[Decision Point]
A. The PC talks to the traveler, and after some time, the traveler notices the PC's interest and gives them a cryptic map.

B. The PC sneaks into the traveler's room later that night and searches it, finding the cryptic map and some uncharged magical crystals.
[Decision Point End]

The map leads the way to a hidden sanctuary deep within the Shattered Cliffs, where the secrets of the arcane are said to be preserved. The Shattered Cliffs got their name from a magical disaster that rendered the landscape seared and twisted, humming with excess magical power in places.

The First Steps - The PC must choose to leave behind their home, family, and friends to follow the map's guidance.

Along the way, the PC encounters challenges and puzzles that test their wits and resourcefulness. They must learn to grow their abilities, beginning to choose where to invest the skill points they gain.

Flawed Companions - As the PC delves deeper into the Whispering Woods, they encounter other travelers, each with their own reasons for seeking the sanctuary. These characters are imperfect; they have flaws, secrets, and motivations. The PC must choose whether to trust them and form alliances or maintain a cautious distance.

The Sanctuary's Gate - After overcoming numerous obstacles, the PC and their companions finally reach the entrance to the sanctuary. However, they are met with a daunting challenge: to enter, they must face their own fears and shortcomings. This emotional and psychological test forces the PC to confront their deepest insecurities and imperfections.

The Silver Hand's Influence - Unbeknownst to the PC, the Silver Hand has been tracking their progress, intrigued by their pursuit of the arcane. Their motivations are complex; while they seek to control magic, they also understand its potential for restoring Atheria to its former glory. Members of the Silver Hand approach the PC with offers of alliance, leading the player to question their own goals and allegiances. The player must also contend with the shadowy offshoot of the Silver Hand, whose extreme actions against magic users blur the lines between friend and foe.

By the end of Act I, the PC has taken their first steps into a larger, more complex world. They have encountered flawed companions and faced their own imperfections. The stage is set for a journey of discovery, growth, and the ultimate battle between the forces that seek to control magic and those who hope to restore the fallen kingdom of Atheria.
