Sorrow's Reach is a small village situated in the province of Arcton. Nestled in a valley surrounded by dense forests, the town is home to a close-knit community of a few hundred people. Among them are farmers, blacksmiths, weavers, and other tradespeople who form the backbone of the village's economy. Life in Sorrow's Reach is simple, and the villagers have survived by adapting to a non-magical way of life. A few individuals still practice small magics but keep their practices to themselves.

Most of the villagers have become resistant to the use of magic, and the few who still practice it are viewed with suspicion or concern. The searing flames of the cataclysm are still fresh in many of the older villagers' minds, and they have no desire to see that kind of destruction again.

## The Surrounding Landscape

Sorrow's Reach is one of three small towns within a few days' journeys of each other, with the other two being Willow's Bend and Raven's Hollow. These towns share a strong sense of community and support one another through trade and mutual protection. The provincial capital, Caelum's Crest, serves as the hub of commerce and politics for the area. The city houses the aging provincial governor who oversees the smaller towns and has been firm but fair while guiding his region through the catastrophe.

## Daily Life

The villagers of Sorrow's Reach work diligently to support their community. Farmers like Old Thomas and his family tend to their crops and livestock, providing food for the village. The blacksmith, Master Rowan, forges tools, weapons, and other necessities, while the weaver, Mistress Elara, crafts clothes and textiles. The village also has a small tavern called The Weary Wanderer, run by a jovial man named Brin, where locals gather to share stories, news, and camaraderie.

The province of Arcton shares a border with the kingdom of Drogath, a land shrouded in mystery and forbidden magic. The people of Arcton have had to endure the effects of their proximity to Drogath. Despite them being welcoming and encouraging trade, there has been a great deal of tension due to the citizens of Drogath's abundant use of magic. This has been particularly challenging for Sorrow's Reach, as it lies on the border and is often caught in the middle of any issues requiring the attention of the Silver Hand. The Gilded Grasp, a powerful merchant guild, is located in Arcton and has been instrumental in facilitating trade between the two regions. Despite the challenges, the people of Sorrow's Reach have remained resilient and determined to make the best of their situation.

## The Village

You reside in a small village called Sorrow's Reach. Nestled in a valley surrounded by dense forests, the town is home to a close-knit community of a few hundred people. Among them are farmers, blacksmiths, weavers, and other tradespeople who form the backbone of the village's economy. Life in Sorrow's Reach is simple, and the villagers have survived by adapting to a non-magical way of life. A few individuals still practice small magics but keep their abilities hidden.

## The Surrounding Landscape

Sorrow's Reach is one of three small towns within a few days' journeys of each other, with the other two being Willow's Bend and Raven's Hollow. These towns share a strong sense of community and support one another through trade and mutual protection. A medium-sized city named Caelum's Crest serves as the provential capital and is the area's hub of commerce and politics. The city houses the aging provincial governor who oversees the smaller towns and has been firm but fair while guiding his region through the catastrophe.

You are an apprentice to the village blacksmith, Master Rowan. Over the years, Rowan has taught the you the art of metalworking, forging horseshoes, plowshares, and simple weapons. Your closest friends are Elias, Old Thomas's son, who shares your love for adventure; Layla, a quiet young woman who spends her days studying old scrolls and books and Seraphina, an intelligent, fiery warrior-to-be, who you practice combat with.

Your relationship with Elias is playful, filled with good-natured teasing, and shared dreams of a life beyond Sorrow's Reach. Elias is a spirited young man who helps his father on the farm and is knowledgeable about the local flora and fauna. He often joins the PC on small adventures into the nearby forests, teaching them about the various plants and animals they encounter. Elias's optimism and sense of wonder profoundly impact the PC, instilling in them a sense of hope and a desire to explore the world outside their village.

On the other hand, Layla is a more introspective friend who challenges your intellect and shares their fascination with the arcane. Layla's family runs the village library, a small but treasured collection of books and scrolls passed down through generations. Layla is well-versed in history, literature, and the arcane arts, despite never having practiced magic herself. Her friendship with the PC is one of mutual intellectual curiosity, as they spend hours discussing their findings and speculating on the world's mysteries. Through Layla, the Player learns about the rich history of Atheria and the lost magical arts, fueling their desire to uncover the truth behind the kingdom's downfall.

Seraphina is intelligent and driven, excelling at combat and the study of the magic arts alike. The Player learned how to fight by drilling with Gareth and Seraphina, who is training for admission into the Paladin's guild: The Holy Palm. She has been given a special permit to study offensive and defensive light magic as part of her training. Seraphina is a determined and strong-willed young woman, unafraid of taking risks and pushing herself to her limits. Her friendship with the PC is one of mutual respect and shared ambition, as they both strive to become skilled warriors and protectors of their village.

Gareth treats the you like a son, you are almost as much his child as Seraphina, filling a small part of the void left since his wife and second child both passed in childbirth.

The world has become much more dangerous without the healing and protection magics that were common less than 40 years ago. Having children has become risky, exploring the wilds more treacherous, and communities have become more insular.
