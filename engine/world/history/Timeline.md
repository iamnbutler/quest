## Historical Events

### 2287: Discovery of the Monolith

Humanity discovers the first alien artifact on an asteroid in the outer solar system, known as the Monolith. This leads to a rapid acceleration of human space exploration and colonization, and it is later revealed to be a relic of the ancient Aethyri civilization.

### 2291: First human colony on the moon

The United Nations Space Agency (UNSA) establishes the first human colony on the moon, known as Luna, as a research outpost. It is later expanded into humanity's first shipyard and spaceport.

### 2295: First Solar War

Fighting breaks out between nations over the Monolith and the resources of the solar system, leading to the First Solar War. Humanity realizes they need to expand beyond the solar system to survive after large-scale destruction of infrastructure and loss of life due to the use of weapons of mass destruction.

### 2297: The Exodus Program

The UNSA catalyzes the Exodus Program, a moonshot plan to colonize three distant star systems in hopes that distance would help insulate against a single conflict destroying humanity.

### 2321: Encounter with The Omnicosm

Humanity encounters the advanced alien species, [[The Omnicosm]], for the first time. Despite the alien species' only ship in the conflict being a single scout, the first colony ship is almost completely destroyed, and the UNSA's fleet is decimated. The technological difference between the two species is staggering, and humanity is shaken to its core.

### 2322: Formation of IDC

After the clear demonstration of [[The Omnicosm]]'s technological superiority, the nations of Earth unite under the UNSA to finish the colony ships and massively bolster the fleet and humanities' military capabilities.

### 2433: Cosmic Radiation Mutation
A wave of cosmic radiation from a nearby supernova passes through the Miridian as it travels through deep space. The radiation causes a mutation in the colonists, altering their physiology.
