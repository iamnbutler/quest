# Myri â€“ The Children of the Stars

Origin: Celeste (Tau Ceti), originally from Earth (Sol)

The genisis of the Myri occured in the year 2433 due to cosmic intervention on the ship the Meridian. The outer band of a supernova passed through the ship, mutating the passengers. The Myri, having developed from [human](humans.md) colonists, initially retained many human cultural elements. However, their unique abilities and physiological differences led them to develop a distinct culture. They tend to be more spiritual and philosophical, often contemplating the mysteries of the universe and their place within it.

The Myri were altered due to prolonged exposure to radiation during a long voyage in the early days of space travel. As a result, they developed the ability to manipulate electromagnetic fields, allowing them to control electronic devices and generate small-scale EMPs. However, their altered physiology also made them susceptible to extreme temperature changes, forcing them to rely on specialized suits and habitats for survival. Over time, the Myri have embraced their unique abilities and established their own distinct culture, often referring to themselves as "Children of the Stars."

## Appearance:

The Myri are humanoid in appearance, retaining many features from their human origins. However, their exposure to radiation has given their skin a luminescent quality, with swirling patterns of color that resemble the night sky.

They have large, expressive eyes, typically emitting a soft glow. Their hair, ears, limbs and beyond all remain similar to their human counterparts.

Their slender build and elongated limbs from many years spent traveling the starts give them an ethereal and graceful appearance.

The Myri usually adorn themselves with garments designed to accentuate their celestial beauty, often incorporating constellations and other astronomical symbols into their clothing and accessories.

## Culture:

The Myri value harmony and unity, both within their society and in relation to other species. They believe that all beings are interconnected and strive to find balance and understanding in their interactions with others. As a result, the Myri are skilled diplomats, often using their abilities to mediate conflicts and facilitate peaceful resolutions.

Their culture places significant emphasis on the importance of spiritual insight and intuitive knowledge. The Myri believe that their abilities grant them a unique understanding of the energy that permeates the universe, and they dedicate much of their lives to exploring this connection. They practice various forms of meditation and engage in introspective exercises to hone their sensitivity to energy and enhance their mental discipline.

Art and science are intertwined in Myri culture, with both pursuits seen as integral to their personal and societal growth. They have developed unique forms of expression, often incorporating concepts from astronomy, physics, and other scientific disciplines into their artwork. Similarly, their scientific endeavors are often driven by a sense of wonder and curiosity, aiming to uncover the mysteries of the universe and understand their place within it.

## Relations with other species:

While the Myri are cautious in their dealings with other species, they are also open to cooperation and collaboration when they see mutual benefit. Their alliance with the Mantasari speaks to their ability to forge strong connections with other species and to share their unique capabilities for the greater good.

The Myri's relationship with humans is more complex as a result of their shared history and their tension with past experiences with the IDC. Despite this, the Myri still maintain some ties with their human counterparts, participating in cultural exchanges and occasionally working together on scientific projects.

Other species generally view the Myri with a mix of admiration and wariness. The Myri's peaceful nature and dedication to fostering harmony earn them respect, but their formidable abilities and mysterious origin also give rise to caution among other species.

With their emphasis on diplomacy and maintaining peace, the Myri are often called upon to mediate disputes and broker agreements between other species. Their willingness to contribute to the stability and security of the galaxy has made them valued allies to many. However, their secretive nature and the exclusionary nature of their technology have sown seeds of distrust among some factions, leading to occasional conflicts and misunderstandings. Overall, the Myri strive to maintain friendly relations with other species, working towards a shared goal of greater understanding and cooperation among the galactic community.
