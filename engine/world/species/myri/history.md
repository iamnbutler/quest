## History:

### 2297: The Exodus Program

The UNSA catalyzes the Exodus Program, a moonshot plan to colonize three distant star systems in hopes that distance would help insulate against a single conflict destroying humanity.

### 2366: Myri Set Out for Tau Ceti

The humans who would later be known as the [[Myri]] set out for [[Tau Ceti]] on their 400-year journey on the colony ship Meridian, marking the beginning of a new chapter in human space exploration.

### 2375: Formation of the Miridian Council

The colonists on the Meridian form an interim council, consisting of representatives from different parts of the ship, to maintain order and govern the long journey to Tau Ceti. The council members are responsible for overseeing various aspects of life on the ship, including resource allocation, security, and the well-being of the colonists.

### 2433: Cosmic Radiation Mutation
A wave of cosmic radiation from a nearby supernova passes through the Miridian as it travels through deep space. The radiation causes a mutation in the colonists, altering their physiology. The colonists become very sick, but the biologist Myriam Kowalski creates an injection that allows the colonists to survive.

### 2434: Radiation Mutation Symptoms

The first symptoms of the radiation mutation begin to appear among the colonists. Initially, these symptoms are mild, such as heightened sensitivity to electronics and minor health issues. However, as the years pass, the symptoms become more severe, leading to illness and distress among the colonists.

//=== Add a few events around cases of Myri's powers getting out of control and causing damage or death, including an event about one Myri going supernova and exploding.

### 2408: Fear Grows on the Meridian

Growing fear over the effects of the radiation lead to a series of protests and riots among the colonists on the Meridian. The Miridian Council struggles to maintain order, and internal strife begins to fracture the unity of the colonists.

//=== Add 2 or 3 events around Myriam Kowalski developing the medicine that help stabalized the Myri and it's aftermath

### 2418: Formation of the Myri Identity

//=== Add an event about developing Myri spiritualism, communing with electronics and the solar system through energy.

### 2421: Development of the Myri Suits

The Myri develop specialized suits to help protect them from environmental factors, such as extreme temperatures, due to their increased sensitivity. The suits also serve to enhance their electromagnetic manipulation abilities, allowing them to better control and interact with the technology on the ship.

### 2422: Miridian Interim Government

The Miridian colonists establish an interim government to maintain order and oversee the remaining journey to Tau Ceti, based on their shared experiences and adaptations during their time in deep space. There is a growing resistance to the idea of being ruled by a government on Earth, and the colonists begin to consider establishing their own independence.

### 2432: Religious and Philosophical Beliefs

The need for hope and purpose during their arduous journey prompts the Myri to develop various religious and philosophical beliefs. These beliefs focus on the idea that the Myri are destined for a higher purpose, often tying their unique abilities to a divine source or celestial plan.

### 2535: Vasquez Tracks Miridian

The UNSA sends a small fleet, led by Captain Elena Vasquez, to follow the path of the Miridian. Equipped with advanced propulsion systems and engineers, they aim to significantly reduce the colony ship's remaining travel time. As they reach the halfway point, they find the colonists on the brink of civil war, as multiple factions vie for control of the ship.

### 2588: UNSA Fleet Reaches Miridian

The UNSA fleet, under Captain Elena Vasquez, catches up with the Miridian. They find a society on the brink of collapse due to internal strife and power struggles among the factions that emerged during their journey. The UNSA faces a difficult choice: intervene and help the struggling society or risk losing the Myri as allies.

### 2592: Miridian Peace Agreement

With the help of the UNSA, the Miridian colonists reach a tenuous peace agreement and establish a provisional government. The factions agree to cooperate in the interest of survival as they approach their destination in the Tau Ceti system.

### 2615: Miridian Arrives at Tau Ceti

The Miridian arrives in Tau Ceti, completing its journey 140 years ahead of schedule thanks to the technology provided by the UNSA. The colonists, now calling themselves the [[Myri]], face the challenge of establishing a new society in their adopted home while navigating the complex relationships with the various factions that developed during their journey. The settle the primary planet and name it Celeste.

### 2611: First Contact with the Mantasari

The Meridian receives a signal from an unknown source. The Mantasari make contact with the alien vessel. They are intrigued by the Myri's unique abilities and history. The initial contact is peaceful, and the two species exchange knowledge and information, the Myri learning more about what is happening in the greater galaxy.

### 2617: Myri-Mantasari Scientific Collaboration

After years of communication, the Myri and Mantasari launch a joint scientific research project, focused on studying the effects of radiation on biological organisms and exploring potential applications for the Myri's unique abilities. This collaboration sparks a technological revolution for the Myri, greatly expanding their knowledge and capabilities.

### 2623: Mantasari-Myri Alliance

The [[Mantasari]] and [[Myri]] form a close alliance, as the [[Mantasari]] are impressed by the [[Myri]]'s unique culture and technology. At the request of the [[Myri]] their existence and alliance with Sylvaris is kept from the [[humans]] while they settle their new society on Celeste.

### 2632: Breakthrough in Electromagnetic Manipulation

The joint Myri-Mantasari research project leads to a breakthrough in the understanding and manipulation of electromagnetic fields. This allows the Myri to refine their innate abilities, gain greater control over their environment, and develop new technologies that rely on electromagnetic manipulation.

### 2634: UNSA Discovers Thriving Myri

A UNSA fleet arrives at Tau Ceti to find the colonists have established a thriving civilization, with three cities and many smaller towns rapidly developing.
