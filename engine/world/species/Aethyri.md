Aethyri
Origin: Luminarion

History: 

A luminous, energy-based species hailing from a highly irradiated star system. The Aethyri are able to harness and manipulate various forms of energy, including electromagnetic and thermal energy. Due to their unique physiology, they require specialized containment fields to interact with other species and their environments. Due to this limitation, it is very rare to see an Aethyri outside of their home system.

The Aethyri avoid the [[Myri]] when possible. The natural power of a [[Myri]] can uniquely disrupt their energy if wielded against an Aethyri, making them deeply distrustful of the [[Myri]].
