Origin:
Celeste (Tau Ceti), originally from Earth (Sol)

Culture:

The Myri, having developed from [human](humans.md) colonists, initially retained many human cultural elements. However, their unique abilities and physiological differences led them to develop a distinct culture. They tend to be more spiritual and philosophical, often contemplating the mysteries of the universe and their place within it.

The Myri were altered due to prolonged exposure to radiation during a long voyage in the early days of space travel. As a result, they developed the ability to manipulate electromagnetic fields, allowing them to control electronic devices and generate small-scale EMPs. However, their altered physiology also made them susceptible to extreme temperature changes, forcing them to rely on specialized suits and habitats for survival. Over time, the Myri have embraced their unique abilities and established their own distinct culture, often referring to themselves as "Children of the Stars."

The Myri are known for their strong communal bonds, with a focus on mutual support and collective decision-making. While they maintain some form of democratic governance, their society is more collectivist than their human counterparts. The Myri's unique abilities have fostered a strong sense of identity, and they are often proud of their heritage and abilities.

In their interactions with other species, the Myri may be initially cautious and reserved, but they are also known for their diplomacy and desire for peaceful coexistence.
