# The Universe

- The genre is scifi, not near future but not in the distant future
- It is more on the side of soft scifi over hard scifi
- The tone is more gritty / scrappy, like the Expanse or Firefly, but not quite a space western
- Life outside the core of each species civilization is tough. There are no utopias, but there are some places that are safer than others.
- Species and individuals might have abilities beyond the natural, but there isn't outright magic that common people would be used to
- Travel time between planets is not instantaneous, but it is not so long that it is impossible to travel between planets. There is no faster than light travel.
- Relationships between species and historical events are impacted by travel time. Species and groups within species that are close to each other are more likely to have a relationship with each other, or have history or conflict with each other, and be involved in the same events.

## Inhabitants of the Universe

- People is not a term that is specific to humans
- People of all species inhabit most core worlds, though some species are more common on some worlds than others. Some species are rare to see on some worlds, like the Aethyri due to their complex biological needs.
- There are no "good guys" or "bad guys", but there are some species that are more aggressive or more peaceful than others.
- Species have different cultures, but they are not monolithic. There are different factions and groups within each species.
- Different species have different levels of technology, but they are all advanced enough to have space travel and interstellar communication.
- Different species doesn't mean they are all non-humanoid, or didn't come from humans in the past. Some event may have occured in the past that caused humans to change or evolve into a different species. This is not a requirement, but it is an option. It is also possible that some species are not humanoid at all.
- It is possible for a species to be completely wiped out by another species, but it is not possible for a species to be completely wiped out by another species in a short period of time.
- If a conflict occurs between species, they should not later suddenly be allies or collaborating. If they are allies, they should not suddenly be enemies unless there is a betrayal or some other event that causes a change in the relationship.
- There should be some events that are not directly related to conflict between species, but are still important to the history of the universe.

## History of the Universe

- There should be some historical events that are important to the history of the universe, and some that are important to the history of a species.
- There should be some reason species gained the ability to travel between planets, and some reason they gained the ability to communicate between planets.
- Some historical events can be positive or collaborative, but others should be openly hostile, including brutal wars, complete subjugation to another species or race with a species, internal conflict between races, class groups and factions inside a species.
- Historical events should effect the latter ones, and some events should permanently change the relationship between species. More than two species can be involved in some events, including the ones described before.
- When creating historical events between species, it is important to consider the relationship between the species before and after the event, and how the event might have changed the relationship between the species.
- When creating historical events remember that individuals and groups can behave irrationally or immorally. Events that are tragedies or atrocities are important to developing the way people see their universe and it's inhabitants.
