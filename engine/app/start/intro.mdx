# The Kingdom of Atheria

In the land of Atheria, once a powerful and prosperous kingdom, ruin and despair now reign. Magic, the kingdom's former backbone, has dwindled into a scarce and dangerous resource. The arcane arts, previously revered, are now feared and strictly regulated by a royal guild known as the Silver Hand. Established by the king to investigate the cause of Atheria's downfall, the guild is determined to restore the kingdom to its former glory.

The eight provinces of Atheria are each home to one of the major guilds that play a crucial role in shaping the kingdom's society and economy.

Sylveria, the western province, is home to the Silver Hand, the King's Guild, overseeing the regulation and discouraging the use of magic throughout the kingdom. The capital city of Sylveria, Haven's Crest, is the seat of the nobility and the place where the king resides and rules from. Haven's Crest's location on the ocean has made it wealthy due to trade, and the city has been a hub of commerce and politics since the kingdom's founding.

In Calendria, in the northwest, the Disgraced Arcanists guild, known as the Sapphire Talon, was dismantled by the Silver Hand 45 years ago, and its members are now forced to practice their magic in secret. The province of Calendria has had a troubled history since the cataclysm. It was home to the famed Archanists Guide, the Sapphire Talon. The conflict between the Silver Hand and the guild came to a head in the province forty-five years ago, leading to a large-scale clash that left many dead and the guild wholly disbanded.

The Silver Hand has had a significant presence in Calendria since, with agents garrisoned throughout the province. This has created animosity among the people who see them as oppressors, suppressing their craft and way of life. Many in Calendria resent the king and the capital for suppressing and regulating magic, as the province has always been known for its skilled arcanists and their magical creations.

The former members of the Sapphire Talon are now forced to practice much of their craft in secret, fearing retaliation by the Silver Hand and its agents. Despite the unrest, the province is rich in natural resources, including fertile farmland and mineral deposits. Many skilled craftsmen still reside in Calendria, producing beautiful works of art and intricate devices, albeit without significant magics.

The Holy Palm, the Paladin's Guild, can be found in Kael, northeast, where its members maintain law and order while upholding the virtues of justice and righteousness. The Artisan's Guild, known as the Gilded Touch, is based on Scepter Isle, located a day west of Sylveria by sailing the ocean, and is responsible for producing beautiful and intricate works of art.

The central provice of Darador is home to the Steel Fingers, the Engineer's Guild, which works to improve the kingdom's infrastructure and technological advancements. The Crimson Claw, a guild of skilled mercenaries, is based in the province of Alderac, to the kingdom's southwest.

The southeastern province of Calladore is home to the Iron Fist, the Blacksmith's Guild, which plays a vital role in equipping Atheria's armies and providing the tools and weapons citizens need. Skilled craftsmen in Calladore produce intricate and high-quality weaponry that is known throughout the kingdom for its excellence.

In the past, despite its significant contributions to the kingdom, Calladore often faced challenges from neighboring provinces due to its reliance on non-magical methods. Now that magic is scarce and tensions high, the province has flourished as demand for armor and weapons has increased.

Finally, the Gilded Grasp, an influential merchant guild, is located in the province of Arcton, on the northern border. Calendria sit to the west of Arcton, and Kael to the east. The provice shares a border to the north with the kingdom of Drogath.

## The Surrounding Lands

To the north of Atheria lies the kingdom of Drogath, a land shrouded in mystery and shunned by most Atherians. The people of Drogath are rumored to possess dark powers and practice forbidden magic. The kingdom has remained isolated and peaceful despite the rumors, allowing Atherians to cross the border freely.

To the east of Atheria lies the desert of Eriador, a harsh and unforgiving land that only the most skilled travelers dare venture into. The nomadic tribes that roam the desert have a reputation for being fiercely independent and hostile to outsiders, making crossing the border a perilous journey.

## Trouble in Calendria

The Shadowed Fist is a secret organization that operates outside the official recognition of the king and the Silver Hand. This militant offshoot has been causing increasing alarm among both the ruling powers and ordinary citizens of Atheria.

The group has been targeting citizens of Calendria and anyone with a slight connection to the disbanded Sapphire Talon. The Shadowed Fist takes extreme measures against those still practicing magic, leaving no evidence behind and making the lives of anyone deemed too liberal with their use of magic a living hell.

Various theories about the Shadowed Fist exist, and their actual goals and members remain unknown. Some people believe they are the king's secret enforcer group, carrying out his orders to suppress any potential threat to the kingdom. Others see them as a group of anti-magic zealots who are capitalizing on the tension between the citizens of Calendria and the Silver Hand.

Regardless of their true motives, the presence of the Shadowed Fist is a growing concern in Atheria, and many fear that they will only bring more turmoil and suffering to a kingdom already on the brink of ruin.
