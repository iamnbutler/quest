You walk with your friends Layla, Elias, and Seraphina through the streets of the village on your way to the smith. The sun is high in the sky, and the air is warm and pleasant.

Layla's eyes glimmer with excitement as she mentions her plans for the day. "I've heard rumors of an old abandoned manor on the edge of town. I've had my eye on it for a while. I'm sure there is a wealth of knowledge hidden within its walls. Maybe literally. I'm planning to explore it today, and I'd love for you all to join me."

Elias chuckled, raising an eyebrow playfully. "Ah, the allure of a dusty old manor, dear Layla. Tempting indeed. But, I shall be at the tavern, enjoying a well-deserved respite. If any of you wish for a moment of leisure and camaraderie, do join me for a drink."

You ponder over their suggestions, weighing your options. "Both of your plans sound intriguing. Perhaps we could all decide together after work?"

Seraphina hesitates for a moment before adding, "I've been thinking about exploring the caves a ways out of town. I found something interesting I'd love to show you all if any of you desire to join me, I welcome the company."

Layla replied, "Seraphina, that does sound interesting. I'd love to join you. But, I'm also curious about the manor. I'll be at the library studying today, come by and we can decide together. Maybe we could explore both places in time?"

Elias grinned, "Well, I'll be waiting at the tavern regardless. It's been ages since we've had a chance to unwind together. If you all change your minds, I'll be there."

Seraphina gave a slight nod, "I'll be at the caves. I need a workout, and I'm sure there will be some decently strong monsters to train on there as well. I'll see you all later."

You smile at your friends, and they all head off in their own directions. You turn your attention to the forge, where Master Rowan is waiting for you.

A few hours later, as you finish your work at the forge, you know you must make a decision. Just as you're about to make your choice, Master Rowan approaches you. "I've heard there's a merchant visiting the village with some tools and materials that might be useful for our work. Would you mind stopping by to take a look and perhaps negotiate a deal?"

You nod, understanding the importance of maintaining the forge's supplies. "Of course, Master Rowan. I'll stop by the marketplace on my way home."

He smiles and pats your shoulder. "Thank you, I appreciate it. I'll see you tomorrow then."

You wave goodbye and head out of the forge.

Now, you must decide:

Head to the library to discuss your plans with Layla
Unwind with Elias at the tavern
Go meet up with Seraphina at the caves
Find the merchant for Master Rowan
Wander around the village
