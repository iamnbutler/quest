   You are apprentice to village blacksmith, Master Rowan. he has taught the you metalworking, forging horseshoes, and simple weapons. You don't aspire to be a blacksmith all your life, but you feel a responsibility to Rowan has put into teaching you. Your closest friends: Elias, Old Thomas's son, who shares your love for adventure; Layla, a quiet young woman who spends her days studying old scrolls and books and Seraphina, an intelligent, fiery warrior-to-be, who you practice combat with.

   Seraphina Grey, a determined and strong willed young woman, born into an 8th generation noble family that fell from grace during the Fall of Atheria.she conducts herself with the elegance and confidence of a true royal. Seraphina is driven by her love for learning, fighting, and exploring with her closest friends, particularly the You, Elias, and Layla, fueling her hunger for growth and self-improvement.

   Layla Blackwood is an introspective and intellectually curious woman, shares her fascination with the arcane with her friends. Her family, who runs the village library, has maintained a small yet valuable collection of books and scrolls for generations.

   Although Layla is well-versed in history, literature, and the arcane arts, she has never practiced magic herself beyond a few basic spells. Your friendship with Layla is based on mutual intellectual curiosity, built on the hours you have spent discussing your findings and speculating on the world's mysteries.

   During her early life, Layla devoted most of her free time to exploring local forests, where she discovered hidden groves, ancient ruins, and creatures both magical and mundane. Captivated by the natural world's wonder, her interest in the arcane grew. As she matured, her fascination intensified, leading her to spend more time studying ancient scrolls and tomes to learn spells and rituals passed down through generations.

   Layla's days revolved around study and adventure. Often setting out early in the morning with a packed satchel and a list of locations to explore, she and Elias would traverse the countryside, mapping uncharted territories and uncovering hidden secrets.

   Layla's relationships brought both joy and heartache. She maintained a strong bond with Elias, who provided unwavering support and encouragement. Layla also formed a close friendship with Delia, the enigmatic traveler who frequently shared arcane knowledge. They would spend hours discussing the intricacies of magic whenever she was in town, which helped Layla grasp the true depth and power of the arcane arts.

   Rosalind and Madeline served as a constant reminder of the competitive nature of the academic world. While Layla struggled with feelings of jealousy and frustration, she also drew motivation from her rivals, pushing herself to excel in her studies and research. Layla often found herself seeking out new and obscure sources of knowledge, driven by a desire to outdo her competitors.

   Her relationship with Seraphina remained complex and challenging. Layla's love for her childhood friend deepened over the years, and she often found herself lost in daydreams of what might have been if she had been brave enough to confess her feelings. Despite this, Layla treasured their friendship and found solace in their shared experiences and the close bond they shared.
